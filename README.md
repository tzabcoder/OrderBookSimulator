# Order Book Simulator

---

### Overview

This project simulates an order book for an arbitrary security. An order book is a list of open buy (bid) and sell (ask) orders showing a security's liquidity. Buy and sell orders are matched by price, quantity, and order time. This order book simulator offers comprehensive features for various use cases such as HFT (high-frequency trading) algorithm development, machine learning experiments, research, etc.
